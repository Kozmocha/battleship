# battleship
A final project for my introductory computer science course which implements a battleship board game.

This project is here because I use GitHub as my portfolio: NOT to enable plagarism.

This is an implementation of the board game 'battleship' that I was assigned to complete during my Freshman year at university.
I completed all back-end development.

If you are in school yourself, you DO NOT have permission to copy my code for your assignments. Your professors will know.
